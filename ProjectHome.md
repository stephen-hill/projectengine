Project Engine is an open source Software Project Mangement System written in ASP.NET C# which will focus on providing good functionality and form; that is, we want it to look good as well as work well.

We will currently being using Google Code to manage the project but once a basic working version is up and running, we will be using our own system to manage the project.
